# WSI_Coding_Challenge

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my level of Java coding competency. The problem that is being solved is: Given a collection of 5 digit zip codes, produce the minimum number of ranges that represent the same restrictions as the input.

## Usage
main.java is a runnable class which takes in user input of zip codes and outputs the minimized list.

## Tests
All of the tests can be found under the test directory. All of the corner cases for the algorithm should have corresponding tests.
